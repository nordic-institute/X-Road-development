### X-Road Development 'Big Picture'

![](IMG/xroad_development.png)

The [Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions](https://niis.org) (NIIS)
owns the X-Road product and maintains Product Roadmap and Product Backlog. The
NIIS is responsible for:

* management, development, verification, and audit of the source code
* administration of documentation
* administration of business and technical requirements
* conducting development, and managing development tools, platforms and practices
* developing and implementing principles of licensing and distribution
* providing second-line support to NIIS members.

The **[NIIS Members](https://www.niis.org/organization-and-management/)**
nominate representatives to the **Advisory Group** and participate in the
**Working Group**. The NIIS organizes and facilitates Advisory Group and
Working Group meetings.
